\arguments{
\item{obs_data}{Data table containing the observed data.}

\item{id}{Character string specifying the name of the ID variable in \code{obs_data}.}

\item{time_name}{Character string specifying the name of the time variable in \code{obs_data}.}

\item{covnames}{Vector of character strings specifying the names of the time-varying covariates in \code{obs_data}.}

\item{covtypes}{Vector of character strings specifying the "type" of each time-varying covariate included in \code{covnames}. The possible "types" are: \code{"binary"}, \code{"normal"}, \code{"categorical"}, \code{"bounded normal"}, \code{"zero-inflated normal"}, \code{"truncated normal"}, \code{"absorbing"}, \code{"categorical time"}, and \code{"custom"}.}

\item{covparams}{List of vectors, where each vector contains information for
one parameter used in the modeling of the time-varying covariates (e.g.,
model statement, family, link function, etc.). Each vector
must be the same length as \code{covnames} and in the same order.
If a parameter is not required for a certain covariate, it
should be set to \code{NA} at that index.}

\item{covfits_custom}{Vector containing custom fit functions for time-varying covariates that
do not fall within the pre-defined covariate types. It should be in
the same order \code{covnames}. If a custom fit function is not
required for a particular covariate (e.g., if the first
covariate is of type \code{"binary"} but the second is of type \code{"custom"}), then that
index should be set to \code{NA}. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{covpredict_custom}{Vector containing custom prediction functions for time-varying
covariates that do not fall within the pre-defined covariate types.
It should be in the same order as \code{covnames}. If a custom
prediction function is not required for a particular
covariate, then that index should be set to \code{NA}. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{histvars}{List of vectors. The kth vector specifies the names of the variables for which the kth history function
in \code{histories} is to be applied.}

\item{histories}{Vector of history functions to apply to the variables specified in \code{histvars}. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{basecovs}{Vector of character strings specifying the names of baseline covariates in \code{obs_data}. These covariates are not simulated using a model but rather carry their value over all time points from the first time point of \code{obs_data}. These covariates should not be included in \code{covnames}. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{outcome_name}{Character string specifying the name of the outcome variable in \code{obs_data}.}

\item{ymodel}{Model statement for the outcome variable.}

\item{intvars}{List, whose elements are vectors of character strings. The kth vector in \code{intvars} specifies the name(s) of the variable(s) to be intervened
on in each round of the simulation under the kth intervention in \code{interventions}.}

\item{interventions}{List, whose elements are lists of vectors. Each list in \code{interventions} specifies a unique intervention on the relevant variable(s) in \code{intvars}. Each vector contains a function
implementing a particular intervention on a single variable, optionally
followed by one or more "intervention values" (i.e.,
integers used to specify the treatment regime).}

\item{int_times}{List, whose elements are lists of vectors. The kth list in \code{int_times} corresponds to the kth intervention in \code{interventions}. Each vector specifies the time points in which the relevant intervention is applied on the corresponding variable in \code{intvars}.
When an intervention is not applied, the simulated natural course value is used. By default, this argument is set so that all interventions are applied in all time points.}

\item{int_descript}{Vector of character strings, each describing an intervention. It must
be in same order as the entries in \code{interventions}.}

\item{ref_int}{Integer denoting the intervention to be used as the
reference for calculating the end-of-follow-up mean ratio and mean difference. 0 denotes the
natural course, while subsequent integers denote user-specified
interventions in the order that they are
named in \code{interventions}. The default is 0.}

\item{visitprocess}{List of vectors. Each vector contains as its first entry
the covariate name of a visit process; its second entry
the name of a covariate whose modeling depends on the
visit process; and its third entry the maximum number
of consecutive visits that can be missed before an
individual is censored. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{restrictions}{List of vectors. Each vector contains as its first entry a covariate for which
\emph{a priori} knowledge of its distribution is available; its second entry a condition
under which no knowledge of its distribution is available and that must be \code{TRUE}
for the distribution of that covariate given that condition to be estimated via a parametric
model or other fitting procedure; its third entry a function for estimating the distribution
of that covariate given the condition in the second entry is false such that \emph{a priori} knowledge
of the covariate distribution is available; and its fourth entry a value used by the function in the
third entry. The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{yrestrictions}{List of vectors. Each vector containins as its first entry
a condition and its second entry an integer. When the
condition is \code{TRUE}, the outcome variable is simulated
according to the fitted model; when the condition is \code{FALSE},
the outcome variable takes on the value in the second entry.
The default is \code{NA}.}

\item{baselags}{Logical scalar for specifying the convention used for lagi and lag_cumavgi terms in the model statements when pre-baseline times are not
included in \code{obs_data} and when the current time index, \eqn{t}, is such that \eqn{t < i}. If this argument is set to \code{FALSE}, the value
of all lagi and lag_cumavgi terms in this context are set to 0 (for non-categorical covariates) or the reference
level (for categorical covariates). If this argument is set to \code{TRUE}, the value of lagi and lag_cumavgi terms
are set to their values at time 0. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nsimul}{Number of subjects for whom to simulate data. By default, this argument is set
equal to the number of subjects in \code{obs_data}.}

\item{sim_data_b}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the simulated data set. If bootstrap samples are used (i.e., \code{nsamples} is set to a value greater than 0), this argument must be set to \code{FALSE}. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{seed}{Starting seed for simulations and bootstrapping.}

\item{nsamples}{Integer specifying the number of bootstrap samples to generate.
The default is 0.}

\item{parallel}{Logical scalar indicating whether to parallelize simulations of
different interventions to multiple cores.}

\item{ncores}{Integer specifying the number of CPU cores to use in parallel
simulation. This argument is required when parallel is set to \code{TRUE}.
In many applications, users may wish to set this argument equal to \code{parallel::detectCores() - 1}.}

\item{ci_method}{Character string specifying the method for calculating the bootstrap 95\% confidence intervals, if applicable. The options are \code{"percentile"} and \code{"normal"}.}

\item{threads}{Integer specifying the number of threads to be used in \code{data.table}. See \code{\link[data.table]{setDTthreads}} for further details.}

\item{model_fits}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the fitted models. Note that if this argument is set to \code{TRUE}, the output of this function may use a lot of memory. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{boot_diag}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the coefficients, standard errors, and variance-covariance matrices of the parameters of the fitted models in the bootstrap samples. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical scalar indicating whether to print a progress bar for the number of bootstrap samples completed in the R console. This argument is only applicable when \code{parallel} is set to \code{FALSE} and bootstrap samples are used (i.e., \code{nsamples} is set to a value greater than 0). The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments, which are passed to the functions in \code{covpredict_custom}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gformula_continuous_eof}. The object is a list with the following components:
\item{result}{Results table containing the estimated mean outcome for all interventions (inculding natural course) at the last time point. If bootstrapping was used, the results table includes the bootstrap end-of-follow-up mean ratio, standard error, and 95\% confidence interval.}
\item{coeffs}{A list of the coefficients of the fitted models.}
\item{stderrs}{A list of the standard errors of the coefficients of the fitted models.}
\item{vcovs}{A list of the variance-covariance matrices of the parameters of the fitted models.}
\item{rmses}{A list of root mean square error (RMSE) values of the fitted models.}
\item{fits}{A list of the fitted models for the time-varying covariates and outcome. If \code{model_fits} is set to \code{FALSE}, a value of \code{NULL} is given.}
\item{sim_data}{A list of data tables of the simulated data. Each element in the list corresponds to one of the interventions. If the argument \code{sim_data_b} is set to \code{FALSE}, a value of \code{NA} is given.}
\item{bootcoeefs}{A list, where the kth element is a list containing the coefficients of the fitted models corresponding to the kth bootstrap sample. If \code{boot_diag} is set to \code{FALSE}, a value of \code{NULL} is given.}
\item{bootstderrs}{A list, where the kth element is a list containing the standard errors of the coefficients of the fitted models corresponding to the kth bootstrap sample. If \code{boot_diag} is set to \code{FALSE}, a value of \code{NULL} is given.}
\item{bootvcovs}{A list, where the kth element is a list containing the variance-covariance matrices of the parameters of the fitted models corresponding to the kth bootstrap sample. If \code{boot_diag} is set to \code{FALSE}, a value of \code{NULL} is given.}
\item{...}{Some additional elements.}

The results for the g-formula simulation under various interventions for the last time point are printed with the \code{\link{print.gformula_continuous_eof}} function. To generate graphs comparing the mean estimated and observed covariate values over time, use the \code{\link{print.gformula_continuous_eof}} function.

\description{
Based on an observed data set, this internal function estimates the outcome mean at end-of-follow-up under
multiple user-specified interventions using the parametric g-formula. See Lin et al. (2019) for
further details concerning the application and implementation of the parametric g-formula.
